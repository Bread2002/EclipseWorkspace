Java: Personal Projects
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------

This repository consists of various Java projects I've worked on over the last year or so. One of the notable projects
is the HangmanGame, a classic word-guessing game implemented in Java. Users can interactively guess letters to reveal a
hidden word within a specified number of attempts. The project not only strengthened my Java programming skills but also
honed my ability to handle user input and make logical decisions for an engaging gaming experience. It was a rewarding
challenge to implement the game's mechanics and ensure a seamless user interface.

Moving on, another intriguing project in this collection is the MazeSolver. This Java program demonstrates my problem-solving
skills as it finds a solution path through mazes using various search algorithms. While still in a very rough work-in-progress
version, MazeSolver utilizes file I/O to load custom mazes and solve them algorithmically. Working on MazeSolver involved
understanding maze representations, implementing efficient pathfinding algorithms, and visualizing the solution. This project
not only challenged my logical thinking but also allowed me to delve into the intricacies of algorithm design within a Java
programming context.

Out of the many projects Iâ€™ve accomplished in my free time and through schoolwork, one that I'd like to highlight is RandomQuoteGen,
programmed quite recently using Java through Eclipse. The program utilized an API from the GitHub repository "quotable," made
by user lukePeavey. Featuring a welcoming message and the option to request new quotes until told otherwise, the program was
designed to interact with quotable's random quote generator API. Each project in this repository represents a unique learning
experience and a testament to my continuous growth as a Java developer.
